## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

#MEDIANA

```{r}
 
median(data$edad)
```

#MEDIA

```{r}

mean(data$edad)
```

#MODA

```{r}

mode <-names(sort(table(data$edad),decreasing = TRUE))
```
